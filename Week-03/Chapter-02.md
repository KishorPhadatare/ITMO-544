Exercises Chapter 2. 
1. Why is design for operations so important? 
-If the design is not created for the operation, it would immediately affect the cost & the profit parameters of the company. 
-Also as the consequences operation will find a lack in their control points for their key interaction. 
-The design for operations is depend on the following: 
Configuration 
Start Up & Shut Down 
Queue Draining 
Data Import Controls 
Auditing 
Exception Collection 
Software Updates 
Backup Restores 
Redundancy 
Replicated Databases 
Access Controls 
Monitoring 
Debugging 
If any of the functionality is not being followed, then it would affect the whole operation. As the result, more cost, time & resources would be involved which results in loss of profit.

2. How is automated configuration typically supported? 
The steps are as follows:

-These operations must be performed before the launch of the system or the once the operation of the system is completed.
-This can be done using api where the steps which needs to be performed are queried internally & will be executed on the execution of the api.
-Another way is by creating binary blob query.
