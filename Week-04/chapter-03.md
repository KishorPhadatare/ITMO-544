# 1. Compare IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS on the basis of cost, con?gurability, and control. 
Ans.
IaaS providers charge for compute time, storage and network traffic. So you could be charged for retrieving data over a network or for storing the data locally.

Bare machines are provided IaaS provider to configure, which are networked for you to install and manage operating system thus giving you total control over it.

PaaS allows you run and manage application on infrastructure provided by the vendor. 

PaaS charges you on how much CPU, bandwidth and storage, similar to IaaS but the costs are higher to make up for the infrasture and service provided.

The provider manages scaling and traffic without any intervention from the user. So you do not  have direct control over the operating system but you have a platform which is programmable.

In SaaS the provider handles all the details of hardware, OS, and the framework, leaving user without any concern for software installation, upgrades and operation. The services are completely managed by the service provider leaving all the details obscured from the user.

# 2. What are the caveats to consider in adopting Software as a Service? 
Ans: 

The user should be able to back-up, migrate and close the service without needing to speak to customer representative.

User should be able to enable or disable any feature wihout needing to speak to customer representative.

The user should have access to all new major releases without delay and in a scheduled manner.

The data privacy issues need to be managed with the provider, the privacy polices of the all users should supercede that of the provider.

# 3. List the key advantages of virtual machines. 
Ans: The advantages are as follows:
Virtual machine can be quickly created or destroyed.

You can easily create API to start, stop, pause or deploy the virtual machines.Virtualized machines are controlled by software hence it is programmable.

Vitual machine monitor allows partitioning of CPU resources to create virtual machines.

# 4. Why might you choose physical over virtual machines? 
Ans:
The CPU shares the processing demands of all virtual machines in total.Thus, shared resources may not be optimally utilized by the virtual machines.

Virtual machine can detect CPU contention, it is the amount of CPU time that your virtual machine is missing because it was allocated to another virtual machine.

It also has physical I/O limits.

Sometimes, they are heavy weight too, they require lot of disk space and hold onto the memory allocated even when not in use. Virtual machine requires resources same as that of a full machine which is very resource intensive.

It also has some components that may not be required.

# 5. Which factors might make you choose private over public cloud services? 
Ans:Private factors can be used for internal work.

Privacy: Private cloud is private in nature. It does not allow other people to access the private information.
Cost: Private cloud is costlier than public cloud but it has their own benefits.
Compliance: Companies who fail to fulfill their comaplaint requirement uses private cloud instead of public cloud in order to fulfill those requirements. 
Control: Private cloud gives the control over its accessibility, hardware & software technology.


# 6. Which selection strategy does your current organization use? What are the benefits and caveats of using this strategy?
Ans: My current organization uses Saas strategy. 
Here, it does not give access to the users to maintain their data. The data is maintained by the organization itself. As the result, the organization knows how to take backup in correct way. It upgrades their softwares during the downtime. As the result, no user gets affected with the same. The maintainence is also well taken care by the organization itself. The data loss can be avoided with the same.
